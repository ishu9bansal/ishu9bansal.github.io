- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Ishu Bansal
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in Data Structures and Algorithms
- üå± I‚Äôm currently working on project which applies concepts of both reactive programming and functional programming.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking for collaborate on multiple projects. Check out my repos and open issues, you can start contributing directly via issues.

Most of my project are learning tool, to ease the understanding of some concept.
This is like a learning inception; we are making things to learn from and in the process learn something else as well.

### Sharing details about a few repos:
#### [Huffman Coding](https://ishu9bansal.github.io/huffman)
Shows how huffman encoding and decoding works. It shows the inner working of the algorithm by interactive controls.
User also get a sense of why this is the best possible compression we could have.

#### [Game of Life](https://ishu9bansal.github.io/game-of-life)
This lets you simulate the Game of Life, in different settings. It has the basic rules of the origional Convey's Game of Life.
User has a lot of control on the environment, also user can pause the iterations and run those one by one. This more than just a fun experiment.
Understanding this may lead to many philosophical and technical ideas, and brings a new perspective of thinking about the world.

#### [Mandelbrot Set](https://ishu9bansal.github.io/mandelbrot)
Wanna explore the infinite mandelbrot set! Zoom into the infinite depth of the mandelbrot set and find some beautiful wallpapers if you want.
This relates to the chaos theory and sparks curiosity of the user. It shows how simple systems could be so chaotic that minute differences in the initial conditions might lead to vastly different results.

#### [Rubik's Cube](https://ishu9bansal.github.io/rubik_cube/)
It's a cube! And it rotates! Maths is Awesome!
Click on the middle square to rotate that face.
Open it on a phone to rotate it with your finger.
Open up the code behind it to learn all the awesome maths behind it.
Projects like these increase my love for Maths.

#### [Ideone](https://ishu9bansal.github.io/ideone/)
This is the DSA learning space. While practicing competetive programming I have made some reusable pieces of codes, which would directly be applied whenever such concept is needed.
So just sharing those codes in this repo. Not only code but the explaination of the code, and its runtime complexities.
Some of the codes are extremely useful, like binary search, inverse modulo, prime factorization, union find algo etc.
Please help me in making this repo rich in quality and quantity. You can check issues in this repo to start contributing.
I have a lot of awesome code to add here, but all that is dormant because there is no explaination associated with that. Need help in documenting those.

Thank you reaching till this point.
I am looking forward to your contributions.
